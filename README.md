# Motor-Control
Summary:
This project is dedicated to replicating the findings from three prominent papers on motor control. A central focus is the simulation of learning rules and memory within the motor cortex across various paradigms. One of the key papers replicated is by Shadmehr, Smith, and Ghazizadeh (2006), which delves into the interplay of adaptive processes with distinct timescales that influence short-term motor learning. Each model's simulation is critically compared to insights derived from this article.
